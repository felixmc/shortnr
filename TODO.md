The following are things I would like to incorporate into future versions of Shortnr, in no particular order:

- Provide the ability to customize character encoding for the static page as well as for HTTP responses in general.
- Implement a revere-regex-like system for defining the length and allowed characters of an URL code.
- Split up the code in app.js into multiple files in order to make the code more modular and easier to read/edit.
- Improve support for the static front end.
    - Maybe include a static file server for serving local files.
- Restructure code for REST service so that it is more modular rather than a bunch of if statements.
    - This should make the creation of new "response" paths neater and easier for a developer trying to customize the code for their needs.
- More customizable and advanced limits system.
    - More timeframes or customizable timeframes.
- Client tracking for API usage beyond IP address (also goes along with improving limits system).
    - Might include a client-id system where clients have to register first.
- Ability for clients to request a specific URL code to be associated with their URL.
    - So that if I wanted to I could register short.nr/felix to felixmc.com
- URL code blacklist, maybe to avoid generating URL codes that might spell offensive words.
    - This would be a must feature if the customizable URL codes feature gets implemented.
- Ability for a shortnr server to manage multiple domains, possibly with multiple databases.
    - For example, hel.lo/world and f.oo/world would link to different URLs despite having the same URL code "world".
- Support for database systems other than MySQL.
- Add IPv6 support for client tracking and analytics.
- Add more comprehensive client filtering based on IP address, similar to Apache's mod_access
- Ability to customize paths in REST service.
    - For example, change the POST /api path to /add or something.
- Ability to customize scope of the client filtering functionality on a path by path basis.
- Implement blacklist/whitelist functionality for what domains can be shortened.
    - Useful for preventive spam by blocking certain domains or even other URL shortening services to prevent double-shortening as a means to concel the final destination of the URL.
- Provide more options for parsing the URL before being inserted into the database.
    - Can include things like removing certain query strings or #'s
- Ability to customize what gets logged in the database.
